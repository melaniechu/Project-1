The two were also in similar clubs and after spending practically every day together through eboard meetings, they became best friends. Since California was a far distance away from Boston, Jen began staying at Mel's house in New Jersey over Thanksgiving Break. This past summer she decided to return the favor and hosted Mel in San Diego at the end of summer break. THe two got to explore where the other calls home and get to know each other even better.</p></div>

    <div class = "east">When you see either of us, I wouldn't be surprised if we're eating. Both of us love food and therefore I had to take Jen to one of my family's favorite brunch spots, <b> Comfi</b>. The cozy family-owned restaurant serves authentic Polish cuisine alongside breakfast classics in heaping portions. You'll always leave with a happy stomach and a box of leftovers to bring home.</div>

    <div class="east">One of my favorite places to drive to when it's nice out is the <b>Grounds for Sculpture</b> in Hamilton. The 42-acre open space is full of contemporary sculpture and figures for you to discover, admire, and take the occasional silly photo with. We visited during an exhibition of Seward Johnson's most famous works, including <i>Daydream</i> which was recreated about 40 feet tall.</div>

    <div class="east">Another nearby town that attracts a lot of visitors is <b>Princeton</b>. The university is made up of beautiful, historic buildings surrounding by small cafes and shops. Despite the colder weather we made sure to taste ice cream from every spot we could find. The shops were also perfect to find unique gifts right before the holiday season.</div>

    <div class="west">I wanted to see what made California beaches so special and <b>La Jolla</b> did not disappoint. The sand was soft, the water was clear, and best of all, you had the chance to get up close and personal with the seals lounging on the shore. With acai bowls in hand, we relaxed and watched them flop around all afternoon.
